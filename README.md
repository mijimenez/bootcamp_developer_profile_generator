## User Story

```
AS A product manager

I WANT a developer profile generator

SO THAT I can easily prepare reports for stakeholders
```

## Business Context

When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN the developer has a GitHub profile

WHEN prompted for the developer's GitHub username and favorite color

THEN a PDF profile is generated
```
